Systemd modification for Anonymity Profiles TODO
==================================================

 * unit tests

 * verification of DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST against the spec -- what
   about DHCP

 * mkosi tests?  looking at HACKING and mkosi, it's not clear to me that
   there's any specific tests to run there --they're just showing you a
   way to make a "legacy-free" system and launch it (so you can fiddle
   with the vm running the new installation, i guess)

 * documentation -- what needs to change to communicate this to the
   local admin?

 * a nice clean series of commits and commit messages that match
   existing upstream practice, to convince upstream that you're serious
   and have paid attention to detail

 * some other ideas (...)
